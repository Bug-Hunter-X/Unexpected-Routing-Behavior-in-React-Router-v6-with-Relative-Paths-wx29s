# Unexpected Routing Behavior in React Router v6 with Relative Paths

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 related to relative path navigation.  When navigating between routes using relative paths (e.g., `Link to="/" `), unexpected behavior might occur, particularly when dealing with nested routes or complex route structures. The issue is rooted in how React Router interprets relative paths within different route contexts.  The provided code showcases the problem and offers a solution.

## Problem Description

The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js`.  Navigating from the `/about` route back to the `/` route using a relative path `<Link to="/">` works correctly. However, the behavior becomes unpredictable in more complex situations (e.g., nested routes, dynamic segments).  The inconsistent behavior might lead to rendering issues, unexpected route transitions, or even routing errors.

## Solution

The solution involves using absolute paths in your `<Link>` components consistently whenever possible to eliminate ambiguity during navigation. This improves predictability and prevents unexpected routing problems. The solution is in `bugSolution.js`

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
